## Mood Diary

This is my "learning Ruby for Real This Time" playground application. I use several applications (mostly mobile) to track health-related things like weight, sleep, water consumption, etc. Each has a way to enter "mood", but only once a day. I want something that allows me to track it throughout the day to help identify trends. I'm sure there are applications out there that do this, BUT, I want to learn Ruby and I do NOT want to write YATDL (yet another to do list).

The goal is to start simple, using only what the base language provides, then, hopefully with some guidance from an experienced Ruby dev, grow it to do more.

Plans:
1. ~~Get the basics working using a simple text file. This means Being able to add a new entry, list entries, clear all entries.~~
2. Multi-line support in the reason.
3. Tags.
4. Display a small report of mood over time.
5. Better back-end. Something accessible from multiple systems.
6. Web front-end.
7. Mobile?
